A few weeks back I was having a conversation with one my ex-colleagues. The guy had done project and programme management for sometime. He had seen the various hardships and shipwrecks. Eventually he changed the course of his journey. I often talked to the guy asking for his opinion. He would listen to me and offer his opinion. But this time the conversation was a little different, as he asked the following career based question to me .

> *Why are you so involved in management ?  You were a technical guy , so how did you aspire to be a project manager ?*

Well to be honest, I was bowled-out at the question. So I spent sometime in charting out my journey so far. Trying to figure out how I reached here.

A few years back, I was a hands-on developer doing mostly individual contributions. I was so the called *Surgeon*, working with text-mining and analysis. I worked with many open sources systems and worked with some communities. I was happy doing my stuff. But then we always look for *increments* and *variable payouts*, so in one of those performance reviews I was told that my performance is just satisfactory. I can no longer just code. I will need to lead a team. I raised the benefits of being an IC. The satisfaction in the role.  But then I was given a choice of having a smaller team.

I started leading and building solution with 2 more people. We delivered the required solution. It worked fine. I kept my interaction limited to the application solution development. Thus, in other meetings with-in the organisation I used to send back one of our team-member, *so called delegate*. Apparently, I got the feedback that *as a I lead I am not doing good. I can not delegate most of the time and I must join organisation meetings. Take part in stakeholder discussions. The organisation also asks project improvement plans for me.* My first response was WTF! We have delivered the project in time with the asked quality. I thought this was the primary ask and I do not want to do the other stuff.

I neglected these things for until my next change, where similar story happened. It looked apparent that being only IC will not help me any longer. So I agreed on the above listed KRAs. I tried to work with my team. I was taking my entry in management. Finally after pushing myself against my dislikes, I made it in my appraisal cycle. But soon found the next dislike, *now I am asked to be a junior manager and take more of the management tasks*. Since I loved development, so I made a bargain for *Engineering Manager*. I have listed my journey of being an EM and then this was followed with a *Project Manager* role. I am still trying to leap back into technology but the PM role is very demanding.

In summary, I never wanted to reach these levels of organisation hierarchy.  I was just doing my responsibilities. I still do application development, but for mentoring. I have been taken away from my primary skill. I have experienced [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle).

 > **Employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.  Thus, people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence".**
